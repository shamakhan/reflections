What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when i initialized the repository it made a .git directory which was not present earlier. We need to do it to use the git features to track the versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is a temporary stage which is yet to be committed while working directory has history that is tracked.

Some new questions

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
with staging area we make sure the changes made in different file are not committed at once but can be individually brought into staging area and then committed

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When we are not sure that the changes will turn out well we can just branch out and then make changes to see how it turns out. 
if all goes well we can always commit and checkout this branch as master
