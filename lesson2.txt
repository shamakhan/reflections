What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when i initialized the repository it made a .git directory which was not present earlier. We need to do it to use the git features to track the versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is a temporary stage which is yet to be committed while working directory has history that is tracked.
