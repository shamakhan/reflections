When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we are working from a different place and don't want to download git, we can simply make changes to our repository 
from github and later pull the changes to our original repository. By using a remote repository we can be sure that the 
data will not be lost even if the original data gets lost from local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?
Because we might not always want to update the changes that we make in our remote repository to the local one. We can 
update changes when we know that valid changes have been clearly and carefully committed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
We use branch while working on local repository to try out new things and changes which aren't sure of yet. We use clone 
to copy a repository to local computer either from a local repository or a remote one. We use fork when we want to work 
on someone elses repository which we don't have right to access to, so that we can work on it form our own local repository
or from our own GitHub account.
