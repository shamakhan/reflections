When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we are working from a different place and don't want to download git, we can simply make changes to our repository 
from github and later pull the changes to our original repository. By using a remote repository we can be sure that the 
data will not be lost even if the original data gets lost from local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?
Because we might not always want to update the changes that we make in our remote repository to the local one. We can 
update changes when we know that valid changes have been clearly and carefully committed.
